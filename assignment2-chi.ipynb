    "A popular application area of Gaussian processes is Bayesian optimisation, where the uncertainty in the probabilistic model is used to guide the optimisation of a function. Here we will use Bayesian optimisation with Gaussian processes for choosing the regularisation parameter $\\alpha$. (We would normally use Bayesian optimisation when optimizing more than one parameter.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian processes are used to represent our belief about an unknown function. In this case, the function we are interested in is the neural network’s validation log root mean square error (log RMSE) as a function of the regularisation paramter $\\alpha$. In Bayesian optimisation, it is common to maximise the unknown function, so we will maximise the negative log RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a Gaussian process prior over this function. As we observe the actual log RMSEs for particular $\\alpha$’s we update our belief about the function by calculating the Gaussian process posterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the Gaussian process framework that you’re already familiar with, Bayesian optimisation involves a so-called acquisition function. Given our Gaussian process posterior model, we use this function to decide which parameter to query next. The acquisition function describes how useful we think it will be to try a given $\\alpha$, while considering the uncertainty that is represented in our posterior belief.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many popular acquisition functions in Bayesian optimisation. One example is the probability of improvement. Suppose we have observed $y^{(1)}$ to $y^{(N)}$ (here negative log RMSE at locations $\\alpha^{(1)}$ to $\\alpha^{(N)}$). Then the function takes the following form: $$\n",
    "    \\mathit{PI}(\\alpha) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu(\\alpha) - \\text{max}(y^{(1)},\\dots,y^{N})}{\\sigma(\\alpha)}\\right),$$ where $\\mu(\\alpha)$ is the Gaussian process posterior mean at location $\\alpha$, $\\sigma(\\alpha)$ is the posterior standard deviation at location $\\alpha$, and $\\Phi$ denotes the cumulative density function of the Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We pick the next regularization constant $\\alpha^{(N+1)}$ by maximizing the acquisition function: $$\n",
    "    \\alpha^{(N+1)} = {arg\\,max}_{\\alpha}\\mathit{PI}(\\alpha).$$\n",
    "We then evaluate our model for this regularization parameter and update our posterior about the unknown function that maps $\\alpha$ to negative log RMSE. We repeat the procedure multiple times and then pick the parameter that yielded the best performance $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function train_nn_reg that trains the neural network from Q4 for a given $\\alpha$ parameter and returns the validation RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $\\alpha$ on the range ```np.arange(0, 50, 0.02)```. Pick three values from this set for $\\alpha$ as training locations and use ```train_nn_reg``` on these locations. Use the remaining locations as values that you will consider with the acquisition function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the performance of the neural network that you trained in Q4 a) as a baseline. Subtract your $\\alpha$-observed log RMSEs from the log of this baseline and take the resulting values as $y^{(1)}$ to $y^{(3)}$. Then calculate the Gaussian process posterior for these observations. To do so, use ``gp_post_par`` from the support code. Use the default parameters for ``sigma_y``, ``ell`` and ``sigma_f``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the probability of improvement acquisition function. You can use scipy.stats.norm.cdf to calculate $\\Phi$. With this acquisition function, iteratively pick new $\\alpha$’s, re-train and evaluate each new model with ```train_nn_reg``` and update your posterior with ```gp_post_par```. Do five of these iterations.\n",
    "\n",
